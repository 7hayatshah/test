## 3. Tech Stack

### Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)

Static web files hosted on modern edge CDN platforms (Netlify or Vercel). JavaScript handles dynamic DOM updates, cart state in `localStorage`, and asynchronous communication.

### Backend & Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

A Database-as-a-Service (BaaS) providing a managed PostgreSQL instance with built-in Authentication, Row-Level Security (RLS), and auto-generated REST APIs consumed directly via the client-side Supabase JS SDK.

### Payment Gateway Integrations

A modular payment engine configured to interface with client-side payment providers:

* **Stripe JS:** For card-based processing using test client keys and payment intents.
* **JazzCash / EasyPaisa / Mobile Wallet API (or Sandbox):** For local wallet number prompt, transaction reference submission, or mock manual verification.
(One or Multiple may be used)
